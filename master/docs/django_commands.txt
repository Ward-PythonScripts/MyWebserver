INCONTINUITIES IN THE TUTORIAL, don't add "django.apps.MainConfig" to the installed apps in the 
settings.py file in the main project directory. But instead add "main"
This seems to work fine so far, must have changed to make it easier to add installed apps.

This webserver will be working with django, in my case I use Virtual Enviroment general39
	pip install django
To start a new django project 
	django-admin startproject <PROJECT-NAME>
In order to launch your website, go into the recently made project folder (with the <PROJECT-NAME> name)
And type the following
	python manage.py runserver 
This will show the local address where to website will be run in the command prompt

In order to create a new webpage, also called a application, we need to type the following
	python manage.py startapp <APPLICATION-NAME>
This will create a new folder with the <APPLICATION-NAME>

Whenever you make changes to the main project file, to add dependencies of an application for example.
It is important that you migrate, so that the main settings files and such will be changed accordingly
	python manage.py migrate 
	
When you have updated the models of a certain application, it is important that you make the migration
	python manage.py makemigrations <APPLICATION-NAME>
In order to apply this, you still need to migrate

If you want to be able to insert stuff into your website you can open up the shell
	python manage.py shell
