This is where we left off.

It is actually kind of a hasstle to just recode everything in javascript
could be unnecesarry, would be very cool if we could save the added file locally on the webserver
and then start a python script that will read from the file and add to a database or something
than the javascript can read from the database and make a chart from the data found in the database
